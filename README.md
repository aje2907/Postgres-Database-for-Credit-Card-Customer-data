# Leveraging Customer Data for Credit Card Success - A Data Driven Approach

This project aims to help a bank improve its services by identifying which clients are good candidates for credit cards. The bank has access to client data, including transaction history, loans, and credit card usage, but the managers require more than a basic discovery tool to understand this data. Therefore, our project will mine and analyze the bankâ€™s data to determine which client characteristics are associated with successful credit card usage. By identifying these factors, we hope to help the bank better understand its clients and improve its services by offering credit cards to those who are most likely to use them responsibly.

To achieve our goal, we are using Postgres Database for storing our data, creating indexes for faster query performance, stored procedures, functions and triggers. We have normalized our database to Boyce-Codd Normal Form and also developed the Entity Relationship Diagram. We have used Python programming language to preprocess the data and create a .py script to load the data into the database by creating a connection with our postgres DB and Python.

We have also created a simple front end UI that can help the user to interact with the data without the need for SQL knowledge. We have developed this using Flask library in Python.
